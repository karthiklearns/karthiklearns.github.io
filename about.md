### Introduction 
Hi, I'm Karthik. Welcome to my website. I'm a graduate of Northwestern University, and I work at the University of Chicago studying 
public policy. 

### Purpose 
This website is intended to house some creative projects that I am working on over the next few months. In particular, 
I will be writing a few kinds of essays:
- podcast reviews 
- political takes 
- short stories 

My goal is to use this little website as an outlet to learn a bit of code, as well as to improve my writing abilities.
