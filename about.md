Hi. I'm Karthik. Welcome to my personal website. 

## A Brief Introduction 
I loathe writing earnestly. I find it embaressing, and relatively difficult. However, I'd like to make an exception here to spell out the reason for this blog's existance. 

Creating this space is an exercise in indulgent daydreaming. Sometimes I imagine someone important reading my political essays or creative work, deciding that I'm some sort of brilliant thinker, and publishing my writing. I've wasted many hours like this, conjuring up the first sentances of short stories or the fleshing out the insights of podcast reviews that I'd like to write, without ever actually committing anything to paper. 

I think the reason it's taken me so long to produce something is that I'm worried about revealing my mediocrity. As long as my work doesn't exist, it can't be criticised. I can believe that it would be excelent. My friends are smart, literary people - and while I think they often respect the way I think and speak, I've watched them brutally rip apart other people's subpar writing. I'd like to avoid that fate. And yet, of course, there is something deeply dissatisfying about never actually writing. 

Given that fear, maybe it's counterintuitive to house my writing in this space, which sits on the boundry between public and private. I supose it's a bit self-mastrabatory: just like how the thrill of exhibitionism comes from the idea of being caught (and not it's realization), it's somehow important to me that my writing could be found, even if it won't be. 

## A Few Requests and Disclaimers 
1. If you know me and you find this blog, let's not talk about it. I know this request is a bit pretentious and self-involved, but I guess I don't really want to talk about my writing with anyone I know right now. I'm aware that it's not very good yet, and so I hope we can all keep the snickering about it to a minimum. 

2. I will be activly rewriting posts on this blog. My intention is to become a better writer, and I've heard that editing mt work is an important element of that. Moreover, especially with regards to political takes, I know from experience that my views evolve over time as I learn more. So, post dates may be inaccurate, and the content of posts may shift over time. 

3. The certainty with which I write doesn't represent the certainty of my beliefs. A dear friend of mine is has imbued me with a deep sense that we tend to be broadly overconfident. I'd like to acknowledge that reality; however, I think that including too many disclaimers will weaken the quality of my writing, so I will try to avoid expressing this sentiment in my individual peices. 

Best, 
Karthik
