Hi. I'm Karthik, a researcher at the Unviersity of Chicago, and a recent graduate of Northwestern University. Welcome to my personal website. 

# Purpose 
I've built this website to learn a little bit about coding, as well as to house a few writing projects I'm currently working on. 

Thanks for checking it out!
